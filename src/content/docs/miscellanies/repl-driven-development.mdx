title: REPL-Driven Development
---

REPL stands for "Read-Eval-Print Loop", which is a program that:

- `R`ead your input
- `E`valuate it
- `P`rint the result
- `L`oop

REPLs are popular in Lisp-family languages like Scheme [^scheme-repl] and
Clojure [^clojure-repl]. They exist within Python, JavaScript, and many other
languages as well, albeit not always as prominently as Lisp-family ones
[^lisp-vs-python-repl]. REPLs play a central role in the REPL-Driven Development
workflow, similar to how tests are central to Test-Driven Development. The
primary concept of REPL-Driven Development is to write code in a text editor,
and then find a way to send it to the REPL to be run. The following diagram
illustrates this process:

```
+------------------+
|      EDITOR      |
|                  +---+
|                  |   |
+------------------+   | code block
|       REPL       |   |
|                  |<--+
|                  |
+------------------+
```

In this diagram, the EDITOR can be any text editor, while the REPL refers to the
specific REPL of the programming language you're using.

For certain content on this site (including posts related to "Software Design
for Flexibility" [^sdf] and "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
[^sicp]), I will use the following tools:

- Neovim [^neovim] as the text editor
- `vim-slime` [^vim-slime] to send code blocks to the REPL
- MIT Scheme [^mit-scheme] as the REPL

Here is a demo I've taken from my SICP exercises solving repository
