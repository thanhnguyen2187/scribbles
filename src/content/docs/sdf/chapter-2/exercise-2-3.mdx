## Description

> Reformulate `parallel-combine` to be a composition of two parts and allow the

## Analyzing

"Multiple values" has its own section, where the author shows us how to
implement `spread-combine` using a new implementation of `compose` and a new
function, `spread-apply`.

```scheme
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (compose h (spread-apply f g)))

(define (compose f g)
  (define (the-composition . args)
    (call-with-values (lambda () (apply g args))
                      f))
  (restrict-arity the-composition (get-arity g)))

(define (spread-apply f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (values (apply f (list-head args n))
                (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

An important bit that was under-mentioned is the `call-with-values` usage:

```scheme {3,4}
(define (compose f g)
  (define (the-composition . args)
    (call-with-values (lambda () (apply g args))
                      f))
  (restrict-arity the-composition (get-arity g)))
```

The "original" `compose` implementation looks like this (the actual composing
is highlighted):

```scheme {3}
(define (compose f g)
  (define (the-composition . args)
    (f (apply g args)))
  the-composition)
```

The comparison above should clarify us how `(call-with-values … f)` replaces `(f
…)`. The author did not fully explain why should we use `values` instead of
returning a list and apply it. I have no idea why either. Let's hope that this
part can be revised later.

There is also the "version 2" of `spread-apply`, where `let-values` is used:

```scheme {7-8,17-19}
;; version 1
(define (spread-apply f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (values (apply f (list-head args n))
                (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))

;; version 2
(define (spread-apply f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (let-values ((fv (apply f (list-head args n)))
                     (gv (apply g (list-tail args n))))
          (apply values (append fv gv))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

A quick search yielded me this post from
[docs.scheme.org](https://docs.scheme.org/guide/multiple-values/), which is
about both "multiple values". The author mentioned `let-values` as well, with an
interesting quote about continuation [^continuation-rabbit-hole]. For now, let's
give our focus back to "multiple values" and `let-values`.

> `let-values` - used like `let`, but binds values to identifiers

Going back to making `parallel-combine` works, we should look at the "basic"
implementation of it:

```scheme
(define (parallel-combine h f g)
  (define (the-combination . args)
    (h (apply f args) (apply g args)))
  the-combination)
```

We were asked to make it

> - a composition of two parts, and
> - allow the parts to return multiple values

Which means we should somehow make use of `compose` and `values` and
`let-values` as needed.

## Implementation

### `parallel-combine`

The final implementation is quite similar to `spread-combine`:

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-3.scm"
  id="parallel-combine"
  lang="scheme"
/>

There is a newly-defined `combine-apply`, which is similar to `spread-apply` as
well [^strange-error]:

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-3.scm"
  id="combine-apply"
  lang="scheme"
/>

[^continuation-rabbit-hole]: https://docs.scheme.org/guide/multiple-values/

    Right on the start of the article, there is an intriguing quote:

    > At its core, Scheme’s evaluation semantics is multiple-value based.
    > Continuations can accept an arbitrary number of values and expressions can
    > yield an arbitrary number of values. This is in contrast to the functional
    > languages ML and Haskell.
    
    I think "continuation" was mentioned in SICP, but I cannot recall the
    definition too well. It should be the rabbit hole for another time.

[^strange-error]: I hit a very strange error with another implementation, where:

    - `restrict-arity` doesn't get respected,
    - which stops `get-arity` from working,
    - and `compose` is broke as a result.

    ```scheme "(get-arity g)" "(restrict-arity the-combination (length args))"
    (define (combine-apply f g)
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (restrict-arity the-combination (length args))
        (let-values ((fv (apply f args))
                     (gv (apply g args)))
          (apply values (append fv gv))))
      the-combination)

    (define (compose f g)
      (define (the-composition . args)
        (call-with-values (lambda () (apply g args))
                          f))
      (restrict-arity the-composition (get-arity g)))
    ```
