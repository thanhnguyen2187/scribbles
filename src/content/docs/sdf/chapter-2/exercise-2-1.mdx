## Description

> The procedures *compose* and *parallel-combine* that we have introduced do not
> obey the requirement that they advertise the arity of the combination. Thus
> they would not be good citizens of our family of combinators. Fix the
> implementation of *compose* and *parallel-combine* shown above, so that:
> 
> - they check their components to make sure that the arities are compatible;
> - the combination they construct checks that it is given the correct number of
> arguments when it is called;
> - the combination advertises its arity correctly for *get-arity*.

## Analyzing

There is an example from the text on how to do that with `spread-combine`:

- The "before" version:

```scheme
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (h (apply f (list-head args n))
           (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      the-combination)))
```

- The "after" version:

```scheme
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (h (apply f (list-head args n))
           (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

We can notice the usage of

- `get-arity`, and
- `restrict-arity`

Which should guide us on how to actually implement the "fixed" functions.

## Implementation

### `compose`

  id="compose"
  lang="scheme"
/>

### `parallel-combine`

<CodeQuoter

  id="parallel-combine"
  lang="scheme"
/>
