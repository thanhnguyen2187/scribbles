## Description

> Our exposition of useful combinators is flawed in that the arity mechanism we
> displayed cannot handle the more general arity mechanism used by MIT/GNU
> Scheme. For example, the addition procedure, which is the value of `+`, can
> take any number of arguments:
>
> ```scheme
> (procedure-arity-min (procedure-arity +)) = 0
> (procedure-arity-max (procedure-arity +)) = #f
> ```
>
> and the artangent procedure can take either 1 or 2 arguments:
>
> ```scheme
> (procedure-arity-min (procedure-arity atan)) = 1
> (procedure-arity-max (procedure-arity atan)) = 2
> ```
>
> It is useful to extend the handling of arities so that combinators can work

## Analyzing

Let's take a look at the "canonical" implementation of `get-arity`:

```scheme
(define (get-arity proc)
  (or (hash-table-ref/default arity-table proc #f)
      (let ((a (procedure-arity proc)))
        (assert (eqv? (procedure-arity-min a)
                      (procedure-arity-max a)))
        (procedure-arity-min a))))
```

As showed above, `(get-arity +)` (or other built-in operator like `-`, `+`, `/`)
won't work since:

```scheme
(procedure-arity-min (procedure-arity +)) = 0
(procedure-arity-max (procedure-arity +)) = #f
```

The exercise requires us to "extend the combinators to use the more general
arities". There were 3 combinators introduced so far:

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
  (define (the-composition . args)
    (f (apply g args)))
  the-composition)

(define (parallel-combine h f g)
  (define (the-combination . args)
    (h (apply f args) (apply g args)))
  the-combination)

(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (h (apply f (list-head args n))
           (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

Let us also look at the "improved" functions from Exercise 2.1:

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-1.scm"
  id="compose"
  lang="scheme"
/>

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-1.scm"
  id="parallel-combine"
  lang="scheme"
/>

It's clear that our version of `compose` works for "simple" cases, where the
`lambda`s' arities are well-defined:

```scheme
((compose (lambda (x) (list 'foo x))
          (lambda (x) (list 'bar x)))
 'z)

;Value: (foo (bar (z)))
```

However, if we replace `f` of the above example with a `list`, we immediately
get a failure:

```scheme
((compose list
          (lambda (x) (list 'bar x)))
 'z)

;Assertion failed: (eqv? (procedure-arity-min a) (procedure-arity-max a))
```

For `compose`, to make `g` and `f` work with more general arities, we will have
to leverage `procedure-arity-min` and `procedure-arity-max` instead of
`get-arity` to restrict the constraints. To fully solve the exercise, we apply
the same process to `parallel-combine` and `spread-combine`.

## Implementation

### `compose`

Let's get started with making `compose` works first. Let's look at execution
part of `compose`:

```scheme "(f (apply g args))"
(define (compose f g)
  (define (the-composition . args)
    (f (apply g args)))
  the-composition)
```

We need to ensure that:

- `g`'s arity fits `args`, and
- `f`'s arity is at least 1

It leads to this rather "verbose" implementation:

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-2.scm"
  id="compose"
  lang="scheme"
/>

A reminder on why we need to check `(not g-arity-max)`: if the function can
receive an unlimited amount of parameter, `procedure-arity-max` would return
`#f` instead of a number.

Let's check with the failed case above:

```scheme
((compose list
          (lambda (x) (list 'bar x)))
 'z)

;Value: ((bar (z)))
```

### `parallel-combine`

Now that new `compose` worked, we can move to `parallel-combine`. Let's look at
the execution part of `parallel-combine`:

```scheme "(h (apply f args) (apply g args))"
(define (parallel-combine h f g)
  (define (the-combination . args)
    (h (apply f args) (apply g args)))
  the-combination)
```

What we have to check is:

- `f` must be able to fully receive `args`
- The same goes with `g`
- `h` must be able to receive at least 2 parameters

Thus the implementation:

<CodeQuoter
  filePath="/code/sdf/exercise-answers/2-2.scm"
  id="parallel-combine"
  lang="scheme"
/>

### `spread-combine`

Similarly, we look at the application part of `spread-combine`.

```scheme {6,7}
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (h (apply f (list-head args n))
           (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

The problem is a bit more... nuanced here. If `f` has no fixed arity, it means
as the library author, we cannot know the true intention of the library user
when he or she passes us a varied arity function. For example, look at this code
snippet and its evaluation:

```scheme
((spread-combine list + -) 1 2 3 4 5 6)
; (list (apply + args-1)
;       (apply - args-2))
```

Since `+` takes any number of parameters, `args-1` is indetermined, and so is
`args-2`. Our best bet is to fix `f`'s arity. `g`'s arity can follow then.
