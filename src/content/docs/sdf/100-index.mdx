description: About the section "Software Design for Flexibility"
---

In this section, I write down my thoughts and excerpts and answers to
exercises of the book "Software Design for Flexibility" [^sdf]. I'll be adding
more content as I read the book. To run the exercises yourself, you'll need
MIT Scheme [^mit-scheme] installed and the book's supporting code [^code]. The
recommended way to do that is REPL-Driven Development, which I wrote about in
another post [^repl-driven-development].
