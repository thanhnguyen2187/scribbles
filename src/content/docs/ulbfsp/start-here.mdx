title: "Start Here"
---

I came across this article about Talagrand [^qm] on HackerNews [^hn], and was
intrigued by his work done and its potential applications. It inspired me to
write about the book here. My goals are:

- To understand the book and the foundational concepts well enough to explain
  them simply to others.
- To apply what I've learned by creating something useful.

At times, I feel like the kid in this meme. I just hope I can push through the
doubts I've had along the way.
