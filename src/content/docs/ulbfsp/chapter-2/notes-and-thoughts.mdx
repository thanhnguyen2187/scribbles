## Measuring the Size of the Supremum

A precondition is that the processes are
[centered](../terminology.mdx#centered-processes):

> $$
> \mathsf{E}(X_t) = 0 \quad \forall t \in T
> $$

About "size of processes":

> We will measure "size of the process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$" by the

The mentioned Lemma 2.2.1:

> *If the process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is symmetric then*
>
> $$
> \mathsf{E}(\text{sup}_{s,t \in T} | X_s - X_t |) = 2 \mathsf{E}(sup_{t \in T} X_t)
> $$

[Symmetric processes](../terminology.mdx#symmetric-processes) are also
explained:

> A process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is symmetric if it has the same law as the process
> $(-X_t)_{t \in T}$.

I find the explanations quite hard to follow and a simpler explanation might be
easier to grasp, so here we go:

- Suppose we have a symmetric process, it means if we draw a distribution graph
  of the process, it can be "equally" splitted to two halves
- The lemma says that the maximum difference between two points in the process
  $\mathsf{E}(\text{sup}_{s,t \in T} | X_s - X_t |)$ is doubled of the maximal
  value of the process $\mathsf{E}(sup_{t \in T} X_t)$.
- An intuition to understand this is to imagine our process as many points in a
  line, and the "highest" value is $x$. Since the process is symmetric, there
  must be a $-x$ as well. Distance between $x$ and $-x$ is $2x$, which is
  doubled of $x$.
