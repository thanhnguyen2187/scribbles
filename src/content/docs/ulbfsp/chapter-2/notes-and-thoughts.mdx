## 2.2 Measuring the Size of the Supremum

A precondition is that the processes are
[centered](../terminology.mdx#centered-processes):

> $$
> \mathsf{E}(X_t) = 0 \quad \forall t \in T
> $$

About "size of processes":

> We will measure "size of the process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$" by the

The mentioned Lemma 2.2.1:

> *If the process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is symmetric then*
>
> $$
> \mathsf{E}(\text{sup}_{s,t \in T} | X_s - X_t |) = 2 \mathsf{E}(\text{sup}_{t \in T} X_t)
> $$

[Symmetric processes](../terminology.mdx#symmetric-processes) are also
explained:

> A process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is symmetric if it has the same law as the process
> $(-X_t)_{t \in T}$.

I find the explanations quite hard to follow and a simpler explanation might be
easier to grasp, so here we go:

- Suppose we have a symmetric process, it means if we draw a distribution graph
  of the process, it can be "equally" splitted to two halves
- The lemma says that the maximum difference between two points in the process
  $\mathsf{E} \space \text{sup}_{s,t \in T} | X_s - X_t |$ is doubled of the maximal
  value of the process $\mathsf{E} \space \text{sup}_{t \in T} X_t$.
- An intuition to understand this is to imagine our process as many points in a
  line, and the "highest" value is $x$. Since the process is symmetric, there
  must be a $-x$ as well. Distance between $x$ and $-x$ is $2x$, which is
  doubled of $x$.

## 2.3 The Union Bound and Other Basic Facts

> Give any $t_0$ in $T$, the centering hypothesis (2.1) implies
>
> $$
> \mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T} X_t = \mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T}(X_t - X_{t_0})
> $$

To prove it mathematically:

$$
\begin{align}
&\mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T}(X_t - X_{t_0}) \\
=\space &\mathsf{E}[\text{sup}_{t \in T}X_t - X_{t_0}] \\
=\space &\mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T}X_t - \mathsf{E}\space X_{t_0} \\
=\space &\mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T}X_t - 0 \\
=\space &\mathsf{E}\space\text{sup}_{t \in T}X_t
\end{align}
$$

We have $\mathsf{E} X_{t_0} = 0$ since it is a centered process.

The intuition behind it can be explained like this:

- Suppose we have a set of numbers
- We subtract the numbers' values by a random amount to get another set
- The maximal of the first set of numbers and the second set of numbers is the
  same, if the random amount is 0

The author did not elaborate what is $P$, but P denotes probability, and the
formula itself is known as the "layer cake representation" or sometimes as the
"tail formula" for expectation. The intuition behind this formula is that it
"slices" the random variable into layers and sums up the probability of each
layer, which gives the expected value. In the end, we are led to [Markov's
Inequality](../terminology.mdx#markovs-inequality), which states that:

$$
\mathsf{P}(Y \geq a) \leq \frac{\mathsf{E} Y}{a}
$$

And a consequence
