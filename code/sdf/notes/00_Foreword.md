# Foreword

> This book is not a survey, or a tutorial--as I said before, it is a master
> class. In each chapter, watch as two experts demonstrate an advanced technique
> by incrementally developing a chunk of working code, explaining the strategy
> as they go, occasionally pausing to point out a pitfall or to remove a
> limitation. Then be prepared, when called on, to demonstrate the technique
> yourself, by extending a data structure or writing additional code--and then
> to use your imagination and creativity to go beyond what they have
> demonstrated.
