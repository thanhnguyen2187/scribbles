# Exercise 2.1: Arity repair

The procedures *compose* and *parallel-combine* that we have introduced do not
obey the requirement that they advertise the arity of the combination. Thus they
would not be good citizens of our family of combinators. Fix the implementation
of *compose* and *parallel-combine* shown above, so that:

- they check their components to make sure that the arities are compatible;
- the combination they construct checks that it is given the correct number of
  arguments when it is called;
- the combination advertises its arity correctly for *get-arity*.

---

Environment setting up:

```scheme
(load "./sdf/manager/load")
(manage 'new-environment 'combinators)
```

Firstly, we should understand the requirements:

> The procedures *compose* and *parallel-combine* [...] do not obey the
> requirement that they advertise the arity of the combination.

It seems like the original definitions does not check the arity of `f` and `g`,
while checking should be there for "Paranoid Programming Style".

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
  (lambda args
    (f (apply g args))))

(define (parallel-combine h f g)
  (define (the-combination . args)
    (h (apply f args)
       (apply g args)))
  the-combination)
```

An example on how to improve `spread-combine`:

```scheme
;; before
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (compose h (spread-apply f g)))

;; after
(define (spread-combine h f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity f)) (m (get-arity g)))
    (let ((t (+ n m)))
      (define (the-combination . args)
        (assert (= (length args) t))
        (h (apply f (list-head args n))
           (apply g (list-tail args n))))
      (restrict-arity the-combination t))))
```

Testing `spread-combine`:

```scheme
((spread-combine list
                 (lambda (x y) (list 'foo x y))
                 (lambda (u v w) (list 'bar u v w)))
 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e)
```

Following the above example, we might reimplement `compose` as something like:

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
  (let ((n (get-arity g))
        (m (get-arity f)))
    (lambda args
      (assert (= (length args) n))
      (assert (= 1 m))
      (f (apply g args)))))
```

Testing `compose`:

```scheme
((compose (lambda (x) (list 'foo x))
          (lambda (x) (list 'bar x)))
 'z)
```

Not sure how:

```scheme
(manage 'run-tests)
```
